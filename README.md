👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Swick. I
- am passionate about humanity's potential and believe it is endless if we live with intention, I've 
- noticed that together we are greater than the sum of our parts, and my observation has been 
- that empiricism is in our nature. 

Oh and I'm an [optimist](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=optomist).

I would be thrilled to connect with other folks who love solving problems and derive value from purpose.
